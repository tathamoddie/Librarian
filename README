As nice as tinyPM is, its backlog interface is less than ideal for bulk story management. This makes it harder than it should be to deal with a backlog of even a moderate size.

I wanted to be able to see more data on the screen at once and do things like repositioning entire groups of user stories in one go and assigning colors without having to navigate away. This is what Librarian will let you do. (Eventually.)
